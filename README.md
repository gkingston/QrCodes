This was forked from https://github.com/mtaulty/QrCodes

The changes are mostly just taking out holotoolkit and using MRTK

The unity build settings should be "Hololens" as the target device and "ARM64" as the Architecture.  Other choices like "Any" seem to result in performance issues on the Hololens 2.
